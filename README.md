# Motion Sensor Webcam

This Python script uses the OpenCV library to perform motion detection through a webcam. It captures video frames, detects changes between consecutive frames, and marks areas with motion. The script records the start and end times of detected motion and stores the information in a CSV file.
The script is then complemented by visualizing the recorded motion events over time. It uses Bokeh, a Python interactive visualization library, to create an interactive HTML graph displaying the periods of detected motion.
